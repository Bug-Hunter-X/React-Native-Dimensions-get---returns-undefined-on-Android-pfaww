This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return `undefined` initially, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes if your code immediately relies on these values. This happens because the dimensions aren't always available synchronously.
